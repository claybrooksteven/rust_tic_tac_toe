# Overview
A primitive command-line tic-tac-toe game I originally wrote in Python, then ported to Rust a couple years later to teach myself the language basics.
It only supports 3x3 tic-tac-toe right now, and while characters other than X & O can be used, the markers can't be longer than 1 character.
The opponent "AI" is quite primitve, randomly selecting an available move.
